# zabbix-Dell-Force10-v10-s-series
Modified version of Zabbix official Force10 S-series, updated to be compatible with OS10 
Please note that this is not a perfect 1-to-1 transition. Some triggers and item prototypes are simply not available via SNMP for OS10. In particular the fan, PSU, and temperature Applications/Items/Discovery Rules/Triggers have been modified to fit the available items in the OS10 MIBs.
